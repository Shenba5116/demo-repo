The Food Delivery Management System developed in C++ is a backend solution designed to automate and optimize the process of ordering food from multiple restaurants. 
This project demonstrates the practical application of multiple data structures to solve real-world challenges in the rapidly growing food delivery industry.
By mapping appropriate data structures to different operations of the system, the project provides a simple yet powerful model that improves speed, reliability and organisation. 
The system successfully integrates seven core data structures: Queue, Stack, Linked List, Hash Table, Array and  Binary Search Tree (BST).
